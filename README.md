# Converting hours
This Python script converts time from the 12-hour format to the 24-hour format. It takes input in the form of a string representing the time in the 12-hour format and outputs the equivalent time in the 24-hour format.
 
 # Teo positive numbers
 This Python script demonstrates how to interpret two positive numbers as truthy values. In Python, values that are considered "truthy" evaluate to True in a boolean context, while "falsy" values evaluate to False.
 In this case, if 2 of the 3 numbers are positive(greater than zero), then they pass as true, if its not the case, then it should pass as false.
